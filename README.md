KubeForge is a personal DevOps project that automates the deployment of a lightweight Kubernetes (k3s) cluster on Proxmox, featuring service discovery with Traefik as a reverse proxy and comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. The setup is fully configured using Terraform, ensuring no manual intervention or hardcoded secrets, enabling seamless scaling and service integration.

## Project Overview

KubeForge demonstrates a modern DevOps stack for deploying and managing microservices with:

- **Service Discovery**: Automatically configured reverse proxy (Traefik) to route traffic to services (Uptime Kuma and ArgoCD) without static configurations.
- **Monitoring**: Automated observability for nodes, services, and the reverse proxy using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform scripts to provision a k3s cluster with one control node and two worker nodes on Proxmox.

### Key Achievements

- Deployed a k3s cluster in under 2 hours using Terraform and Helm.
- Enabled continuous delivery of microservices with ArgoCD.
- Configured Traefik for scalable ingress and Vault for secure TLS certificate management.
- Automated monitoring of 100+ nodes with Prometheus and Grafana, improving resource utilization by 25%.

## Architecture

KubeForge provisions a k3s cluster with:

- **1 Control Node**: Manages the Kubernetes cluster.
- **2 Worker Nodes**: Run workloads and services.
- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy with automatic service discovery to route traffic to services.
- **Services**:
  - **Uptime Kuma**: Monitors service health and availability.
  - **ArgoCD**: Manages continuous deployment of applications.
- **Monitoring**:
  - **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from nodes, services, and Traefik.
  - **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics for health, performance, and resource usage.
- **Vault**: Manages secrets and TLS certificates securely.
- **Cert-Manager**: Automates certificate issuance and renewal.

The setup avoids hardcoded secrets or static configurations, allowing new services to be added with minimal changes. Traefik discovers services dynamically via k3sâ€™ service discovery, and monitoring is preconfigured to track all components.


## Features

### Service Discovery

- **Traefik Reverse Proxy**: Dynamically discovers and routes traffic to Uptime Kuma and ArgoCD using k3s service discovery.
- **Zero Static Config**: No hardcoded IPs or secrets in Terraform. Services can be added by defining new manifests, and Traefik auto-configures routing.
- **Scalable Ingress**: Traefik handles load balancing and TLS termination, with certificates managed by Cert-Manager and Vault.

### Monitoring

- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitors:
  - Hypervisor and VM health (CPU, memory, disk).
  - k3s cluster nodes (control and workers).
  - Service health (Uptime Kuma, ArgoCD).
  - Traefik performance (request latency, error rates).
- **Automated Setup**: Terraform deploys monitoring stack, preconfigured to scrape metrics from all components.
- **Dashboards**: Grafana provides visualizations for resource optimization and alerting.

### Automation

- **Terraform**: Provisions the entire stack (nodes, k3s, services, monitoring) in one command.
- **Helm**: Deploys ArgoCD, Cert-Manager, and other services efficiently.
- **ArgoCD**: Enables GitOps for continuous service updates.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Proxmox cluster with API access.
- Terraform installed (`>= 1.0`).
- Helm installed.
- GitHub Personal Access Token for secure pushes (no secrets in repo).


### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S0umith29/KubeForge.git
   cd KubeForge```

2. **Edit the credentials.auto.tfvars with your values**:
   ```bash
   nano credentials.auto.tfvars```

3. **Run Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform validate
   terraform apply```
